        <p>For my first example of writing that I have completed was a biography of my uncle Nou Toua Muas who is now 87 and his life from Laos to America and his struggles through life. It is an assignment that I obtained from a teacher that made a big impact on how I viewed my own culture and my cultures origins. And the struggles that my elders took to arrive in America. This biography shows me how he went through his life from being a villager to a refugee to a citizen. His life changed when he lived in the refugee camp. I chose this sample to share because it is something that is important to me that has helped me gain my own confidence and my own thoughts and is helping me currently learn my purpose.

            Lyrics :  <br>
            “
            Flowing through the breeze <br>
            And we’re trying not to <br>
            Lose our self again <br>
            Trying not to fight the fire in side <br>
            Fighting our own life on the inside <br>
            Fighting our way out we  <br>
            Flow <br>
            Through <br>
            The <br>
            Time <br>
            We had <br>
            <br>
            Learning <br>
            From <br>
            Our <br>
            Past <br>
            Mistakes.  <br>
            ” <br>

        <p class="special_song">For my second excerpt, here are a few lines from an old song that I wrote for a friend who was struggling with their own mental health and how their SO (Significant Other) affected them through this time and how they hurt them even more while I was there helping from the side. This song is a personal song that means alot to me cause it helped them realize what they needed and what they have to go through in their own daily lives. The purpose of it is to help those who need it and to help those who were or are in the same situation. And the reason I chose it is because it is a song that has helped so many of my friends gain their confidence to get over their ex’s and their own struggles. It's called “Mental Fight”. And here is a small snip of the lyrics. Have Fun and Enjoy. BTW a bit sad ngl…
