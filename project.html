            <p>Delve Homes was the first serious project that I have worked upon while it is also a fun and simple website that was
            created by using the story The Machine Stops by E.M Forster where I had a team of people working with me to create a
            promotional website that would sell the underground living spaces where we were allowed creative freedom and this
            allowed us to be able to have fun with this project and to have a good time while exploring the ways that we have
            gathered through and the ways that we have thought of.

            <p>Conciliatory health is a website where I personally had the freedom to do whatever I wanted while I also was allowed to
            be able to create a website that represented what I wanted. It was a group / team project that allowed me to be able to
            comprehend and understand Mental Health around the world as that was the focus that i decided upon while it was fun it
            was also a eye opening experience learning the ways that people cope within everything they do as I have lost several
            friends through this before.</p>

            <p>Happy Little Dinosaurs otherwise known as HLD was a fun project that me and a few classmates worked upon to turn a fun board game that we found into an exciting game that was on the web while being free to play and cost nothing. We had experienced what it feels like to make a game as we all worked together to code and create how the game runs while also making it consistent within how it looks.
