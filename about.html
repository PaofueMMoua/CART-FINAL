        <p class="abt_me_txt">Welcome to My Life. I am a 16 year old Hmong American student studying at Clovis High and at C.A.R.T (The Center for Advanced Research and Technology). Iâ€™ve grown up as the youngest male within my family. My life has been weird as throughout elementary school I grew up with my friends without always being the best student. Through middle school I began taking music and began coding as through this time I began by learning simple languages to understand like python while I also gained some attention within my musical career by placing within top 5 players in FMCMEA (Fresno Madera County Music Educators Association).  Then Covid 19 Hit (Dramatic Music)*  From there all work needed to be done at home. Through Sophomore and Junior year I became more social and more accepting of myself but I dropped out of my music courses and did pick up making music ironically. Then through that whole time I came to where I am now.
